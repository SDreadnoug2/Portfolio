# Portfolio

This project is really a breath of fresh air for me, as it's one of my earliest opportunities to just work on and build something from the ground up, in my eyes.
I'm glad I've been able to actually commit to this and have something to show already.

This is built entirely in React, and will be used to showcase future projects, and highlight any of the creative work that I continue to pursue in my free time.
